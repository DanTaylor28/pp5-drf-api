# Social Media Backend API

In this API, my goal was to implement the functionality to handle all the necessary data needed to create a fully functional social media platform. I loosely based this project on the popular picture sharing website Pinterest. The API has full CRUD(create,read,update and delete) functionality which lets registered users upload their own posts with the optional ability to include a title, caption and category. You can edit or delete posts as long as you are the owner of them which is ensured with the addition of authorisation in this project. In addition, signed in users can pin posts they would like to add to their boards, while also having the ability to comment on posts and liking others users comments.

Users can follow other profiles and you have the ability to customise your own by changing your profile picture, your location and adding a bio. When creating posts, you can optionally assign it to a category. If you do so, I plan to implement the functionality of searching for a specific category and having all posts associated with it displaying on the front end. Categories can also be added to posts later in time since that field is present and can be updated when editing a post.
